Did code review with Basel because partner never responded.

Basel said the code overall looked very well done.

He said that should have done more tests in an organized manner and to use sk learn's pipline tools.

He also said for the presentation, maybe get rid of some of the code, and only have the results because a lot of the code is unnecessary.
